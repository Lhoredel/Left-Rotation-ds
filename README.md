# Left-Rotation-ds
This code solves the Left Rotation problem by performing a circular left shift on an array. It splits the array at the rotation point and concatenates the two portions in reversed order to achieve the left rotation effect. The algorithm efficiently handles the rotation using list slicing operations with O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.
